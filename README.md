# Cubeman

This is a 2d platformer game written in JavaScript and HTML Canvas that is a work in-progress.

To play Cubeman run it on your browser. I simply use VS Code's Live Server Extension.

Thus far the game features a controllable character, collision detection, numerous 2d sprite animations, enemies, and a parallax background.
